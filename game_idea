   * the door to exit

   1. Plant, there's a key in the pot for the safe
   2. A desk. On the desk there's a:
      -pen. it doesn't write.
      Under the desk there is a:
      -safe. the key from the plant opens the safe, which in
      turn contains a diary
      -diary. the diary is written in the perspective of
       a person named "Jack" who woke up in the room. He
       never escaped, but there's no body in the room.
   3. A wardrobe. It contains a small note, which reads "8".
   *  There is a small "5" scratched above the door


Instructions: are shown at the beginning of the game and optionally with "instructions."

Room Reporting: in my implementation it's "area reporting", but it works the same way. It doesn't
go through the possible exits and list them, but it does implicitly do that in the description
of the area. I did this purposely, for style.

Conditional Movement: It's present in the game. Most notably you can't get to the pot
unless you're in the corner and you can't get to the safe unless you're by the desk.

Limited Resources: A good example of this is the "key", which is found only once,
destroyed when the safe is opened, and never able to be found again.

Rooms: There are several "areas" in the room. They are:
-door
-safe
-center
-wardrobe
-corner
-pot
-desk
-safe

There are only 8, but if I have time I'll try to add 2 more so I meet the requirements.

Objects: There are several objects:
-key
-pen
-diary
-note

There are only 4, but I'll try to add another one if I find time.
